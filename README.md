### Tracki is an android application used to track the working hours of employees.

Whiles I was looking for app idea to create to enrich my portfolio I came up onto idea to create app which tracks employees attandance and how much hours they clock during work week. This project will contain two applications. First application is for android devices, and second application is backend application for storing data which will use PHP and MySQL. First I will focus on building android application then will shift my focus on backend and make database for application.
